V-Clean is a resource-aware smart waste management system built for African cities. It combines IoT-enabled smart bins, drone-based waste hotspot mapping, and a mobile citizen reporting platform to help local governments and communities reduce urban pollution and improve public health.

## 🌍 Problem

Over 125 million tonnes of waste are generated annually in Africa, with less than 10% properly collected or recycled. Overflowing dumpsites, drainage blockages, and poor sanitation contribute to flooding, disease, and environmental degradation—especially in low-income urban areas.

## 💡 Solution

V-Clean is built to operate in **resource-constrained environments** where power, internet, and infrastructure are limited.

### Key Components:
- **Smart Bins:** Solar-powered bins with ultrasonic sensors and GSM modules for real-time waste monitoring.

- **Drone Mapping:** High-resolution drones integrated with GIS to detect illegal dumpsites and monitor waste patterns.
